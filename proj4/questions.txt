Question 1:
	Does your program run the same way each time? Why?

	- My program does not run the same way each time as the scheduler does not maintain the same order each time it is run on the CPU. Since there are multiple processes running on the machine, it is not possible to tell how the scheduler will behave in catching and releasing the semaphores. 

Question 2:
	Give your last customer thread the highest priority. Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?

	No, giving the last customer thread the highest priority does not ensure that the customer is given first priority as it might have to wait for a lower priority thread to be done working with a semaphore. Therefore, it must wait till the thread has returned the semaphore to make any further progress.
